<h1 align='center'> ROBOT MAZE FIAP </h1>

  <h2 align='center'>At FIAP RoboCup 2022, we were given a challenge to be solved in Java. Here’s the problem statement:
<br>
</h2>
  
  <br>
  
Deliver a program, written in Java, that simulates the robot's movement within this track. The commands will be given by the user in pairs: COMANDO ("FRENTE" - "FORWARD", "TRÁS" - "BACKWARD", "ESQUERDA" - "LEFT", "DIREITA" - "RIGHT") and DISTÂNCIA (10, 50, 30, 20, etc.).

DELIVERABLES: A track and a program that (1) can reach the goal (complete the track) with any number of commands, controlling the battery power, and (2) can verify whether commands are VALID or INVALID.
